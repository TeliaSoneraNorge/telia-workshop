// We want to fetch a random fact off an external REST API endpoint (by using axios).
// We use state to keep track of the data.
// Also, we have to handle any errors that might occur.
// Then, we want to display the fact itself, if available, and a button to load a new one.
// If there is no facct yet, we want to read "Load". If there is a fact, it should say "Reload".
