/*
 Hey, hi!
 You find the exercises in the exercises folder. They contain (hopefully) helpful comments.
 Possible solutions are available - who would have expected that - in the solutions folder.

 For the first several exercises, we use the require() syntax below.
 Once we reach the state where we can (and will) import modules, we do this by using the second code snippet.
 You can easily "swap" the two styles by deleting one of the two asterisks, *, in the first comment (in line 16).

 Have fun!
